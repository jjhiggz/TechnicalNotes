# Low Riders Of The West

## Introduction: 
Low Riders of the west is a non-profit organization dedicated to getting stray dogs their rightful home. As a tech team we are dedicated to making their website as good as possible so that way we can get these dogs a home as soon as possible. 

Because of COVID-19 there has been an especially high amount of dogs in need of their forever home, so we believe that anything we can do to help is a step in the right direction.
